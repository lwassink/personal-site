# Luke Wassink Personal Website
I created to [lukewassink.com](http://lukewassink.com/) to display my personal projects and to blog about topics in computer science and techology that interest me.

## Frontend
This site is a single-page app.
It was written in Javascript using React, Redux, and React Router v4.

## Backend
This site is hosted on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu.
It is served by an Nginx reverse-proxy server.
Content is served locally to nginx by a Rails 5 app running in API mode, while static assets are served by a Node Express Server.
