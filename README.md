# Luke Wassink Personal Website
I created to this site to display my personal projects and to blog about topics in computer science and techology that interested me.

## Frontend
This site is a single-page app.
It was written in javascript using React, Redux, and React Router v4.

## Backend
This site is hosted on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu.
It is served by an nginx reverse-proxy server.
Content is served locally to nginx by a Rails 5 app running in api mode, while static assets are served by a node express server.
